CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS using the machine learning (random forest classifier)
 Conclusion

In this analysis, we explored customer churn based on a dataset containing customer information. We found that the churn rate is 20%, and there are differences in factors such as age, subscription length, monthly bill, and total data usage between churned and non-churned customers.

Understanding the factors that influence churn is essential for businesses to develop strategies to retain their customers. Further analysis and predictive modeling may be conducted to identify the key drivers of churn and implement retention measures.

This report provides valuable insights for the business to take proactive steps to reduce churn and increase customer retention.

For more in-depth analysis and specific recommendations, further investigation is recommended.
